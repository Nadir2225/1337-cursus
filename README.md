# 🧠 1337 Cursus — My Full Journey

**Repository:** Nadir2225/1337‑cursus

This repository contains my entire coding journey through the **1337 Coding School** curriculum — a project‑based, peer‑learning training program focused on building real software engineering skills from the ground up.

1337’s curriculum is built around **hands‑on projects** and skill sets that help students think like programmers and adapt to real‑world challenges. Students learn by doing, collaborating, and solving problems — no traditional lectures, no memorizing slides.
